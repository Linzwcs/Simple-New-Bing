# Simple-New-Bing

## Description

Simple-New-Bing is a low profile version of New Bing. It imitates the New Bing to answer user's question by combing news on the Internet.

### implemented functions

1. I complete two crawlers myself, and news sources are from Sina News and Global Time.
2. Simple New Bing supports language including English and Chinese.
3. The project supports to use LLaMA deployed on your PC to replace Chatgpt.
4. Simple New Bing can also handle user's input by using NER model, and then get the sequence of entities. The project use these extracted entities as keywords to search news. Regarding the NER model, you have two options: 1. you can use spacy, which is a open-source NLP library containing the NER pipline. 2. in this repository, I have completed a Bert-Bilstm model. You can use it to sovle the NER problem.

## Usage

### Environment

firstï¼Œyou need to use conda to create new virtual environment. For instance:

```
conda create -n openai python=3.11
```

then, run the following command to import the environment:
